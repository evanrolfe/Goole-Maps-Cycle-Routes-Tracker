From Luka:

* Home link is not linked to the correct first page
* at Home page there are missing latest news
* Home page has title Front_Page instead of HopOnBike.com
* is it possible to create drop-down menus more rounded?
* remove all link under Trips but Links and in Community remove link Travelogue
